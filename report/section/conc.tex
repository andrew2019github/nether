Detecting virtualization can also have benign use. Virtual Machine Based Root-kits (VMBR) make AV software have to detect virtualization as well~\cite{thompson, ferrie2007}. Examples are BluePill~\cite{bluepill} and Vitriol~\cite{vitriol}, both using virtualization extensions (both Intel and AMD). Therefore, the research community should be aware of the fact that completly transparent VMs can also be a double-edged sword.
