In this paper, we have explored the VM detection method mentioned on nEther\cite{nether} and its countermeasures. Software based VMs are infeasible to be transparent due to their countless bugs. However, we have made suggestions on defending against anomaly based techniques such as CPU errata. Although we did not really evaluate the defense, we believe that anomaly based detection schemes are feasible to be patched.
Detecting virtualization can also have benign use. Virtual Machine Based Root-kits (VMBR) make AV software have to detect virtualization as well~\cite{thompson, ferrie2007}. Examples are BluePill~\cite{bluepill} and Vitriol~\cite{vitriol}, both using virtualization extensions (both Intel and AMD). Therefore, the research community should be aware of the fact that completly transparent VMs can also be a double-edged sword.
