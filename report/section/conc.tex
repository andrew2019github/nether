In this paper, we have explored the virtualization detection methods mentioned
in nEther~\cite{nether} and its countermeasures. Software-based virtualization
are infeasible to be transparent due to their countless bugs. However, we have
proposed techniques against CPUID and CPU errata based attacks. Although a thorough investigation
into evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques was not conducted,
we believe that CPUID and CPU errata based detection schemes are feasible to be patched.
