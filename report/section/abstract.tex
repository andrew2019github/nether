\textbf{
nEther\cite{nether} has broken the transparent malware analysis virtual machine (VM) environment called Ether\cite{ether} by taking advantage of CPUID field, CPU errata, and timing based detection. Even though there has been a lot of efforts on keeping the VM transparent, the malware authors are winning the fight because detecting VM is easier than preventing detection. In this paper, we study significant VM detection techniques and suggest defense techniques against them.
