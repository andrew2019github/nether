{\bf Ether~\cite{ether} showed how virtualization extensions, such as Intel
  VT-x, could be utilized to do transparent malware analysis, using an
  out-of-guest analyzer, achieving both fine-grained and course-grained
  analysis. Later, nEther~\cite{nether} broke the transparency of this
  environment by exploiting involuntary side effects to certain instruction, by
  looking for false negative bugs caused by CPU errata, and lastly, certain
  differences in timing. Even though there has been significant efforts in
  keeping virtualized environments transparent, the malware authors are winning
  the fight because detection is arguably easier than prevention, due to the
  fundamental approach of virtualization and emulation of hardware. In this
  paper, we study significant detection techniques and suggest new methods of
  defense against certain attacks. }
